cost-calculator
===============

one page html, css and jquery app to calculate running costs

The exercise started life in September 2013 as a daily programming practice session.
At the end of the month when I had a basic working version I asked friends to help
me with new features. What did people actually want? Continued development is not
only about fixing bugs and refactoring code but actively listening to users even
before building the thing.

TO-DO LIST
- possibly change the delete button to a X icon
- make a theme switcher drop-down menu
- possibly have a currency chooser (request from Alex)
- save to .pdf and print stylesheet (Alex)
- show annual cost for each item on row (Simon)
- inline editor (Simon)

Working example can be found at:

Developed almost exclusively using vim on Ubuntu 12.0 and also on Mac OS 10.6.8.
Tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Safari Mobile.
